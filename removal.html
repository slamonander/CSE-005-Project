        <h3>Info about Malware</h3>
        <p>Malware is used for cyberattacks to cause extreme amounts of damage to a computer network system to allow hackers to receive sensitive information. With the whole world going digital, these attacks are happening more and more every year and hackers are learning more ways to get malware into your computers.
            Malware means malicious software. It’s developed by cyberattacks to cause extreme amounts of damage to a computer network system to allow hackers to retrieve sensitive information. The malware removal process has been increasing every single year. The earliest malware attack can be dated to the early 1970s when computer defenses were at a minimum security. Ever since then, major companies encountered thousands of different variants of malware attacks every year. In the last ten years alone, malware attacks have increased to 86.38 percent and are increasing every year. One a computer has been infected; quick actions need to be taken to protect your data. The first thing you need if your system is infected is to unplug all devices from the electrical outlet: computer, modem, router, hard drives, anything that uses electricity to function. Then identify the infected device and see a local computer specialist to get rid of the malware.
            1. Malware infection
            •	Opening fishy emails with attachments from unknown senders is the most common way people get malware infection.
            •	Drive by downloads. People who download files off the internet from unsecure sites allow malware to infect one’s computer.
            •	Clicking on links on websites. This is a very tricky one because opening a random website and accidentally clicking on a random part of the website can instantly infect your computer with malware.

            2. Malware removal for PC
            Malware isn’t just limited to only PCs, it can also invade mobile devices as well. mobile malware is an attack that has been increasing in the last five to ten years with the increasing number of mobile devices. First thing is to disconnect your mobile device from the internet to prevent further spreading. Then activate safe mode to only allow basic functions of the device. Delete any suspicious apps or files that you don’t recognize. Clear your cache to removed saved malware in your device. Then when all else fails reset the device to its factory settings which would delete everything.
            •	If you have no clue what to do, the best course of action is to unplug all infected computers from the electrical outlet. This will prevent any further spreading of loss of important information to hackers.
            •	If you have an idea of what the cause of the infection is, then you should disconnect your PC from the internet to prevent the spread of infection and keep it contained to one device only.
            •	If you think it was something you have downloaded, deleting temporary or newly downloaded files might fix the problem.

            3. Malware removal for phones
            With the increasing number of internet attacks, people need to understand and prevent malware attacks. The use of strong passwords using capital letters, lower case letters, numbers, and special characters all in one password seem to be the most effective. Backing up important documents and files is extremely important to not lose any sensitive information in case a full factory reset is required. Reboot the infected device with safe mode with network settings. Removing any connected devices from each other to prevent the spread of infection. Deleting any suspicious files or applications that you don’t recognize. Keep your devices up to date help prevent malware attack as the hackers have to reinvent a new malware to meet the current computer updates. 
            •	Downloading strange 3rd party applications is the most common way that smartphones get infected with malware so deleting strange apps is ideal.
            •	Turning off the device and putting it into safe mode will turn off all 3rd party apps and some first party apps to allow only basic functionality of phones to allow you to delete any suspicious files you may have downloaded.
            •	Factory resetting is your last option. This is the last resort because by factory resetting your phone will delete all apps, pictures, contacts, videos, and anything else that is saved on the phone and will revert everything back to its base settings deleting everything in the process. 
            Malware can infect your computer with the click of a button. Unfortunately, many computer owners don’t have the technical skills to understand, yet alone, identify what malware even is. My personal recommendation is, if your computer is infected with malware or any other sort of virus, just unplug that device and let a trained professional handle the situation to prevent further infection. Malware is serious and a simple DIY or YouTube video won’t fix the problem, especially if you don’t have a large amount of computer knowledge.
