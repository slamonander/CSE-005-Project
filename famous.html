<h2>How larger companies prevent ransomware
</h2>
Larger corporations adopt a comprehensive approach to thwart ransomware attacks, emphasizing employee training, robust technical safeguards, and proactive security measures. This involves routinely educating staff on cybersecurity to identify and steer clear of phishing attempts, implementing network segmentation for infection containment, securely maintaining current backups, and promptly applying security patches. A layered defense is achieved through advanced antivirus solutions for endpoint protection, email filtering to identify and block malicious messages, and enforcing the principle of least privilege. Additional security layers include multi-factor authentication, a clearly defined incident response plan, and regular security audits to promptly identify and address vulnerabilities. Collaborating with cybersecurity experts and adhering to legal and regulatory compliance further bolsters the overall security posture, resulting in a comprehensive and adaptive defense against ransomware threats.





    <h3>How ransomware is Identified</h3>
</h3>
<p>Finding ransomware requires looking at it from several perspectives, such as utilizing technical skills, seeing how things behave, and adhering to good cybersecurity procedures. One major red flag is when your computer unexpectedly freezes up and you can't access your data. Typically, the folks behind ransomware demand payment in order to release your files. Another clue is if you see weird things happening with your internet connection, such as excessive activity. Also, if your files have strange names or new ends, this might indicate that ransomware has tampered with them. Paying attention to how your computer behaves, such as if it suddenly starts consuming a lot of resources or displays apps you don't recognize, can assist you in detecting a possible ransomware problem. 
<h4>Ways they deal with it when they fail to prevent it
<h4>
Organizations address the threat of ransomware by combining proactive and reactive strategies. Proactive measures involve comprehensive training programs for employees to identify and avoid potential risks, the implementation of robust cybersecurity procedures such as network segmentation and regular data backups, and the deployment of advanced tools for endpoint protection. In the event of a ransomware attack, companies often depend on predefined incident response plans detailing specific actions to identify, isolate, eliminate, and recover from the infection. Swift detection and containment of affected systems, along with secure backup practices, empower organizations to restore normal operations without succumbing to ransom demands. Moreover, companies may engage in collaboration with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement agencies, and strict adherence to legal and regulatory standards ensures a well-coordinated and effective response to ransomware incidents, strengthening the overall resilience of their cybersecurity posture.





<h5>Conclusion
  <p> Despite numerous ransomware attacks over the years, Sony appears to have taken one of the worst ones to date. These incidents continue to happen at a smaller yet more frequent rate, leaving its users increasingly vulnerable. While users' credit card information has been compromised, there haven't been any reported cases of unauthorized purchases using these cards. Sony intends to take legal action against the hacker group, claiming that the ransomware attack caused $600,000 worth of damages to their company. In the realm of large-scale malware attacks, the 2011 Sony malware attack on all PlayStation players remains one of, if not the most significant ransomware attacks on a single company.
