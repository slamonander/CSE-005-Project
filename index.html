                    <h2>Malwares that are designed to damage/encrypt/steal data, disrupt a computer's system, and demand ransom while holding
                        the user's data hostage.

                        <li><b>WIPER MALWARE:</b> Erases user data and ensures the data cannot be covered. Used to take down computer networks in companies
                        as well as cover up traces left after an intrusion.</li>
                        <li><b>VIRUSES:</b> Steals data, launch DDoS attacks, or installs ransomware. The only difference from a virus to a worm and 
                        Trojan is that it needs the infected application to run.</li>
                        <li><b>WORMS:</b> Accesses the system through backdoors built into the software, through software vulnerabilities, or through
                        flash drives. Worms can also launch DDoS attacks, steal data, or launch ransomware attacks.</li>

                        Can be inserted into a system through phishing, social engineering, or malicious downloads.</li>
                        <li><b>TROJANS:</b> Disguises itself as a legitimate code, which then takes control of the user's systems.</li>
                        <li><b>MOBILE MALWARE:</b> Distributed through phishing and malicious downloads. Jailbroken phones are especially vulnerable
                        to these attacks due to the lack of protection from the device's original OS.</li>

                    user's consent.</li>
                    <li><b>FILELESS MALWARE:</b> Changes files that are native to the operating system,
                    making the attacks more successful since the OS recognizes these files as legitimate.</li>
                    <li><b>BOTS:</b> A software that performs automated tasks. Many bots (a botnet) can launch a broad flood of attacks, like 
                    DDoS attacks.</li>

                    into applications, kernels, hypervisors, or firmware. Spreads through phishing, malicious attachments, downloads, and 
                compromised share drives. Rootkits are also used to conceal other malware(s).</li>
