    <!-- CATEGORY 1 -->

    <h1>DATA AND SYSTEM DISRUPTORS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>RANSOMWARE:</b> Disables victim's access to data through encryption until a ransom is paid.</li>
        <li><b>WIPER MALWARE:</b> Erases user data and ensures the data cannot be covered. Used to take down computer networks in companies
        as well as cover up traces left after an intrusion.</li>
        <li><b>VIRUSES:</b> Steals data, launch DDoS attacks, or installs ransomware. The only difference from a virus to a worm and 
        Trojan is that it needs the infected application to run.</li>
        <li><b>WORMS:</b> Accesses the system through backdoors built into the software, through software vulnerabilities, or through
        flash drives. Worms can also launch DDoS attacks, steal data, or launch ransomware attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- CATEGORY 2 -->
    <h1>INFORMATION THEFT</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>SPYWARE:</b> Collects data activity without the user's knowledge.</li>
        <li><b>KEYLOGGERS:</b> Monitors user's activity. Can steal password data, banking information, and other sensitive information.
        Can be inserted into a system through phishing, social engineering, or malicious downloads.</li>
        <li><b>TROJANS:</b> Disguises itself as a legitimate code, which then takes control of the user's systems.</li>
        <li><b>MOBILE MALWARE:</b> Distributed through phishing and malicious downloads. Jailbroken phones are especially vulnerable
        to these attacks due to the lack of protection from the device's original OS.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- CATEGORY 3 -->
    <h1>NUISANCE AND ADVERTISING MALWARE</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b>ADWARE:</b> Tracks the user's activity to determine the advertisement served to them. This means the user's activity
        is collected to create a profile of said user to share or sell to advertisers without
    user's consent.</li>
    <li><b>FILELESS MALWARE:</b> Changes files that are native to the operating system,
    making the attacks more successful since the OS recognizes these files as legitimate.</li>
    </ul>
