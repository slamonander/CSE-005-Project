                    <h3>[ RANSOMWARE ]</h3>
                    <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that disables the user's access to their data or device
                        through encryption until the user pays a ransom to the attacker. The earliest types of 
                        ransomware attacks only involved demanding a ransom for the encryption key needed to regain
                        access to the user's data or device. However, recently, ransomware attacks have now 
                        included double or even triple extortion.

                        <br><br>Double-extortion attacks include stealing the user's data and leaking it online. Third-extortion 
                        include threats to use stolen data to attack the user's connections.
                    </p>

                    <div class="right-align">
                        <h3>[ WIPER MALWARE ]</h3>
                        <p>Wiper malwares' main purpose is to erase the user's data and ensure that the data cannot be recovered. Wiper malware destroys
                            data through encrypting or overwriting the files' contents or attack the operating system itself. These malwares are
                            used to take down computer networks in companies and organizations as well as cover up traces left after an intrusion.

                            <br><br> Unfortunately these types of malwares have been increasingly used for cyberwarfare. An example of this malware
                            used during wartime is HermeticWiper, used in the Russian invasion against Ukraine.

                    <h3>[ VIRUSES ]</h3>
                    <p>Viruses is a very common type of malware that aims to steal data, launch DDoS attacks, or damage the user's
                        device or network. This can result to disrupted operations, hijacked systems, and corrupted, altered, or deleted data. Unfortunately,
                        viruses can replicate itself in order to spread its attacks on other devices or networks. 

                        <br><br>Viruses can infect a device through malicious downloads, pose as attachments (images, video, audio files),
                        and are mainly attached to an executable file (.exe). However, these viruses do not activate unless the user opens or run
                        the infected application.

                    <div class="right-align">
                        <h3>[ WORMS ]</h3>
                        <p>Worms are also self-replicating malwares, where the only difference from a virus is that it can replicate without
                            "activation" from the user. Normally, these malwares access the system through backdoors built into the software,
                            through software vulnerabilities, flash drives, phishing, or networks.

                            <br><br>Worms attack by consuming bandwidth, deleting files, stealing data, overloading networks, or dropping other
                            types of malwares into the system.

                    <h3>[ SPYWARE ]</h3>
                    <p>Spywares are malwares that invade a user's device to steal and collect the user's sensitive information, track login 
                        credentials and a person's location, and overall monitor the user's data activity. Normally, the goal behind these attacks
                        is to steal credit card numbers, banking information, and passwords.
                        
                        <br><br>Spywares are often installed through malicious downloads, browsing on a malicious website, or as an app install 
                        package. These spywares are hard to detect, but the signs of an active spyware on a device is reducing the processor or network
                        connection speeds as well as data usage and battery life.

                        <h3>[ KEYLOGGERS ]</h3>
                        <p>Keyloggers are a type of spyware where it can log or monitor your keyboard strokes, essentially allowing the attackers
                            to know and record what you are typing. This includes passwords, banking information, what pages you have visited, etc.
                            Keyloggers are usually installed into a system through phishing, social engineering, or malicious downloads and softwares.

                    </div>
                    <h3>[ TROJANS ]</h3>
                    <p>Trojans are a type of malware made to damage, disrupt, steal, and hijack the user's system, data, or network. The reason why
                        Trojans have the said name is due to the face that it can disguise itself as legitimate code. This means that it can deceive
                        the user and not get flagged down by the system easily. However, Trojans has to be activated by the user and it cannot 
                        replicate itself.

                        <br><br>Other attacks by Trojans include DDoS attacks, install malicious programs and malwares, steal account information
                        and data, and allowing the attacker remote access to your device.</p>

                    <h3>[ MOBILE MALWARE ]</h3>
                        <p>Mobile malwares are a type of malware that aim to target mobile devices, including tablets and smartphones. Jailbroken
                            phones are especially vulnerable to these attacks due to the lack of protection from the device's original operating
                            system. These malwares can be distributed through phishing and malicious downloads.

                            <br><br>Mobile malwares attacks include stealing financial information and passwords, conduct cryptomining on a victim's 
                            device, or hijack a device to generate income through fake ad clicks.

                    <p>Adwares are malwares known to generate revenue by tracking a user's activity to determine what advertisements to generate
                        and send to the said user. This also means that the user's activity is collected to create a profile of the user to
                        share or sell to advertisers without the user's knowledge or consent.

                        <br><br>Adware pops up as unwanted pop-up advertisements on your device and can be installed through malicious programs,
                        downloads, or even through a vulnerability in the software or operating system that enables the attackers to install the adware 
                        into the system.

                            it does not rely on files and does not leave traces of its intrusion on the system. These malwares attack by changing the files
                            that are native to the operating system, gain access to the system, steal credentials, collect the user's data, and set up a 
                            backdoor for the attackers to access the system more easily.

                            <br><br>These malwares are installed through phishing and social engineering.

                        and typically imitate user behavior as well as gain control over the user's device. It can launch a broad flood of attacks,
                        ranging from DDoS attacks to hacking user accounts. A network of these bots are called a botnet, which means that a network
                        of devices are running 1 or more bots, making botnet traffic come from multiple IP addresses. 

                        <br><br>Bots can infect a computer through malicious downloads and phishing.

                            itself from the system. It can allow the attacker to remotely execute files, access the system, log files, and spy
                            on the user without user's knowledge. Rootkits can be installed into applications, kernels, hypervisors, or firmware
                            and often spreads through phishing, malicious downloads, and compromised share drives. 

                            <br><br>Unfortunately, rootkits have multiple capabilities from stealing the user's data to creating a backdoor for the attackers
