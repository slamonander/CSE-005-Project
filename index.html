                        vulnerabilities, or through flash drives. Worms can also launch DDoS attacks, steal data,

                    <p>Mobile malware can be distributed through phishing and malicious downloads. Jailbroken phones are 
                        especially vulnerable to these attacks due to the lack of protection from the device's original OS.
