    <!-- CATEGORY 1 -->

    <h1>DATA AND SYSTEM DISRUPTORS</h1>
    <h3>Malwares that are designed to damage/encrypt/steal data, disrupt a computer's system, and demand ransom while holding
        the user's data hostage.
    </h3>


    <ul>
        <li><b>RANSOMWARE:</b> Disables victim's access to data through encryption until a ransom is paid.</li>
        <li><b>WIPER MALWARE:</b> Erases user data and ensures the data cannot be covered. Used to take down computer networks in companies
        as well as cover up traces left after an intrusion.</li>
        <li><b>VIRUSES:</b> Steals data, launch DDoS attacks, or installs ransomware. The only difference from a virus to a worm and 
        Trojan is that it needs the infected application to run.</li>
        <li><b>WORMS:</b> Accesses the system through backdoors built into the software, through software vulnerabilities, or through
        flash drives. Worms can also launch DDoS attacks, steal data, or launch ransomware attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- CATEGORY 2 -->
    <h1>INFORMATION THEFT</h1>
    <h3>Malwares used to capture and monitor the user's activities, steal data, and compromise systems on devices.</h3>


    <ul>
        <li><b>SPYWARE:</b> Collects data activity without the user's knowledge.</li>
        <li><b>KEYLOGGERS:</b> Monitors user's activity. Can steal password data, banking information, and other sensitive information.
        Can be inserted into a system through phishing, social engineering, or malicious downloads.</li>
        <li><b>TROJANS:</b> Disguises itself as a legitimate code, which then takes control of the user's systems.</li>
        <li><b>MOBILE MALWARE:</b> Distributed through phishing and malicious downloads. Jailbroken phones are especially vulnerable
        to these attacks due to the lack of protection from the device's original OS.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- CATEGORY 3 -->
    <h1>NUISANCE AND ADVERTISING MALWARE</h1>
    <h3>Malwares that bombards users with unwanted advertisement, compromise and take control of systems, and/or exploits
        users.
    </h3>

    
    <ul>
        <li><b>ADWARE:</b> Tracks the user's activity to determine the advertisement served to them. This means the user's activity
        is collected to create a profile of said user to share or sell to advertisers without
    user's consent.</li>
    <li><b>FILELESS MALWARE:</b> Changes files that are native to the operating system,
    making the attacks more successful since the OS recognizes these files as legitimate.</li>
    <li><b>BOTS:</b> A software that performs automated tasks. Many bots (a botnet) can launch a broad flood of attacks, like 
    DDoS attacks.</li>
    <li><b>ROOTKITS:</b> A software that can remotely control a user's computer with full admin privileges. Can be injected
    into applications, kernels, hypervisors, or firmware. Spreads through phishing, malicious attachments, downloads, and 
compromised share drives. Rootkits are also used to conceal other malware(s).</li>
    </ul>
