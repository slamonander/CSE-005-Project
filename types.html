    <!-- Section: Data Systems -->
    <h2 class="categories" id ="datasystems">data systems and disruptors.</h2>
    <div class="container" id="category1">
        <h3>Malwares designed to <span class="colored-text">damage, encrypt, or steal</span> data,
        <span class="colored-text">disrupt</span> a computer's system, and <span class="colored-text">demand ransom</span>
    while holding the user's data hostage.</h3>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">1. ransomware</h4>
    <p>A type of malware that disables the user's access to their data or device through 
        encryption until the user pays a ransom to the attacker. The earliest types of 
        ransomware attacks only involved demanding a ransom for the encryption key 
        that is needed to regain access to the user's data or device. 
        <br><br>
        However, recent ransomware attacks now include double or triple extortion.
        <br><br>
        <span class="colored-text">Double extortion attacks:</span> Steals the user's data 
        and leaks it online.
        <br><br>
        <span class="colored-text">Triple extortion attacks:</span> Threats to use stolen 
        data to attack the user's connections. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">2. wiper malware</h4>
    <p>A malware used to erase the user's data and ensure the data cannot be recovered. Wiper malware 
        destroys the data through <span class="colored-text">encrypting/overwriting</span> the files' 
        contents or <span class="colored-text">attack the operating system</span> itself. 
        <br><br>
        These malwares are used to take down computer networks in companies and organizations as well as
        cover up traces left after an intrusion.
        <br><br>
        Unfortunately, these types of malwares have been increasingly used for cyberwarfare. An example 
        of this malware used during wartime is the <span class="colored-text">HermeticWiper</span>, 
        used in the Russian invasian against Ukraine.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">3. viruses</h4>
    <p>A common type of malware that aims to <span class="colored-text">steal data, launch 
        DDoS attacks, or damage the user's device or network.</span> This can result to disrupted 
        operations, hijacked systems, and corrupted, altered, or deleted data.
        <br><br>
        Viruses can replicate themselves in order to spread onto other devices and networks. The 
        infection and the spreading is possible through malicious downloads and attachments and 
        they are mainly attached to an executable file <span class="colored-text">(.exe)</span>.
        <br><br>
        These viruses do not activate unless the user <span class="colored-text">opens or runs 
            the infected program.
        </span>
    
    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">4. worms</h4>
    <p>A self-replicating malware where the only difference from a virus is that it can replicate 
        without "activation" from the user.
    <br><br>
    Normally, these malwares access the system through <span class="colored-text">backdoors built 
    into the software, software vulnerabilities, flash drives, phishing, or networks.</span> 
    <br><br>
    Worms attack by:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>Consuming bandwidth</li>
        <li>Deleting files</li>
        <li>Stealing data</li>
        <li>Overloading networks</li>
        <li>Dropping other types of malwares into the system</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="categories" id="informationtheft">information theft.</h2>
    <div class="container" id="category2">
        <h3>Malwares used to <span class="colored-text">capture and monitor</span> the user's activities, 
            steal data, and compromise systems on devices.</h3>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">1. spyware</h4>
    <p>A malware that invades a user's device to <span class="colored-text">steal and collect the user's 
        sensitive information, track login credentials and location, and monitor the user's data activity. </span>
        The goals behind these attacks are usually to steal credit card numbers, banking information, and passwords. 
        <br><br>
        Spywares are often installed through <span class="colored-text">malicious downloads, browsing on a 
        malicious website, or as an app install package.</span> 
        <br><br>
        Spywares are hard to detect, but the signs of an 
        active spyware is if it reduces the <span class="colored-text">processor, network connection speeds, data usage, 
        and battery life.</span>

    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">2. keyloggers</h4>
    <p>A type of spyware that <span class="colored-text">logs and monitors your keyboard strokes</span>, which allows 
        the attackers to know and record what you are typing. This includes passwords, banking information, 
        what pages you have visited, etc.
        <br><br>
        Keyloggers are usually installed into a system through phishing, social engineering, or malicious downloads and 
        softwares.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">3. trojans</h4>
    <p>A type of malware made to damage, disrupt, steal, and hijack the user's system, data, or network.
        <br><br>
        The reason why trojans have their name is because it can <span class="colored-text">disguise 
        itself as a legitimate code, deceiving the user and avoid getting flagged by the system easily. </span>
        However, trojans has to be "activated" by the user and it cannot replicate itself.
        <br><br>
        Other attacks by trojans include:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>DDoS attacks</li>
            <li>Installing malicious programs and malwares</li>
            <li>Steal account information and data</li>
            <li>Allow remote access to your device</li>
        </ul>

    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">4. mobile malware</h4>
    <p>
        A type of malware that <span class="colored-text">targets mobile devices </span>, including 
        tablets and smartphones. Jailbroken phones are especially vulnerable to these attacks due to 
        the lack of protection from the device's original operating system.
        <br><br>
        These malwares can be distributed through phishing and malicious downloads.
        <br><br>
        Mobile malware attacks include:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Stealing financial information and passwords</li>
            <li>Conduct cryptomining on a victim's device</li>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">1. adware</h4>
    <p>A malware known to <span class="colored-text">generate revenue by tracking a user's activity 
        to determine what advertisements to generate and send to the user.</span> This also means that 
        the user's activity is collected to create a profile of the user to share or sell to advertisers 
        without the user's knowledge or consent.
        <br><br>
        Adware pops up as unwanted pop-up advertisements on your device. They can be installed through 
        malicious programs, downloads, or a vulnerability in the software or operating system.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">2. fileless malware</h4>
    <p>
        A software that uses <span class="colored-text">legitimate programs to evade the antiviruses 
        and cyber security defenses.</span> It does not rely on files and does not leave traces of its 
        intrusion on the system. Fileless malwares are installed through phishing and social engineering 
        and can attack by:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>Changing files that are native to the operating system</li>
            <li>Gain access to the system</li>

        <br><br>
        A network of bots, called a botnet, is a network of devices that is running 1 or more 
        bots. This means that it makes botnet traffic come from multiple IP addresses.
        Bots can launch a broad flood of attacks, ranging from DDoS attacks to hacking user accounts 
        or devices.
    </p>

    <h4 class="anotherheader">4. rootkits</h4>
    <p>
        A software that can <span class="colored-text">remotely control a user's computer with full administrator
